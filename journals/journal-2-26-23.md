# Journal Entry For 2/26/2023

> ## **App Setup**
>
> Today I set up the main components of the app: Users, Social, and Matches, along with the React w/ ChakraUI.
> It always feels nice to set up a new app and I think using Django is going to take a lot of the stress away from using a new framework.
> The only "new" thing I'm using is ChakraUI and I really think it isn't all that hard to use and makes UI super fun.
> I feel like this is coming off a little disingenuous because journaling is.. weird, but I swear I'm being genuine.

> ## **Hopes For Tomorrow**
>
> I wanna set up the the APIs for at least one app, I could really do matches and users in one day.
> I need to do some testing on the endpoints, maybe even write a few unit tests
> to make sure everything is running as intended.
> As excited as I am for front-end stuff, I need to hold off on it until I have a solid backend.
> Messaging is a stretch goal, as far as I'm concerned. It's vital to the apps funtionality, but realistically people
> just need to be able to match first, that needs to happen before anything.
> I feel like I have no clue as to how to accomplish the messaging aspect; I know it's going to be
> websockets or something, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.
